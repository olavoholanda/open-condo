# OpenCondo - Open Source Social Condominium

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/olavoholanda/open-condo.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/olavoholanda/open-condo)

OpenCondo is an open source Java Rest API for social interaction among condominium communities.
Currently, this project is under development and there is no stable version yet. Therefore, there isn't a demo
application for this project.

This project is built using micro service pattern, every service is developed using Spring Boot and they
all are registered using Spring/Netflix eureka.

#### List of Services

* Account Service - Service that manages user accounts;
* Forum Service - Service responsible for the forum feature;
* Eureka Service - Spring/Netflix Eureka Server service;

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local
machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This project has minor requirements, the databases and servers are embedded, so if you need a non in memory
database for each service, you will have to change each service configuration property file.
So, the requirements are:

```
Java 1.8
Maven 3.x
```

### Building

Each service has its own instruction for running. As a micro service pattern they all should be 
independently, however they need the Eureka Server running first, so they can register in it.

To build the application use maven command line: 

```
mvnw clean install
```

If you want to run from the main folder you need to execute the following command line for each service:

```
mvnw spring-boot:run -pl account-service
```

To proper run, please execute eureka service first.

## Running the tests

The project uses JUnit for unit tests. To run the tests with maven command, use:

 ```
 mvnw test
 ```
